This directory contains all of the python scripts needed to run the solar system simulation. The PhysicsVector.py file defines the PhysicsVector object which will be used to control the motion of the planets. The PlanetObject defines the Planet objects which allow you to create planets of a given size, mass etc. A few useful constants are defined inside the constants.py file. Then the simulation is actually run in the SolarSystem.ipynd Jupyter Notebook.
