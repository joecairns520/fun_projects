This repo will be used to store some fun and interesting coding projects that I'll go through! This repo will include:

1. Monty Hall Problem - A simple Jupyter Notebook I set up to investigate the stats behind the Monty Hall problem.

2. Solar System Simulation - A simple solar system simulation modelling the trajectories of the planets using the Euler-Cramer method. This was a first attempt at making an object-oriented python code during my undergrad, which I adapted from the Java code I make for one of my modules.
